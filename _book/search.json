    "text": "Resource Overview\nIndigenous people are the original stewards of the coast and seas of the Pacific Coast region. They maintain a font of knowledge that is essential in understanding the state of coastal ecosystems and their fate in a changing climate. This resource seeks to honor that legacy by collecting different accounts, studies, and programs that promote Indigenous perspectives in coastal ecosystem stewardship. It seeks to both explore existing examples where Indigenous communities are managing resources in tandem with settler governments (or “co-management”) as well as issues related to food sovereignty with respect to both wild harvest and cultivated foods. While focused on multiple regions of the Pacific Coast, the resource will highlight resources with particular relevance to California.\nCo-management is becoming a reality across fisheries, aquaculture operations, and protected area management throughout the Pacific Coast. Government-to-government relationships have been strengthened in several regions with Native people (re)gaining decision making power in some cases. There are several formalized examples of this in Washington and Canada, with other important lessons from regions with strong Indigenous fishing, aquaculture, and coastal stewardship practices like Alaska and Hawai’i. California, while behind other states, is beginning to explore this model in the governance of the state’s marine protected area (MPA) network.\nThere are many pathways towards restoring the ancestral responsibilities of coastal Indigenous people, and co-management is not always the preferred outcome. The government-to-government agreement does not fit cases where Indigenous groups do not have federal recognition in the United States. The second section of this guide is dedicated to food sovereignty, seen as an essential component of cultural connectivity and self-determination for Indigenous people around the world. Food sovereignty can exist both within and outside of conversations of c-management. This guide explores perspectives on food sovereignty through both wild harvest of marine resources as well as long-practiced aquaculture methods throughout the region.\nThe guide concludes with a review of existing partnerships across Indigenous communities that sometimes include collaboration with non-Indigenous entities. These collaborative efforts are becoming more visible and providing opportunities to pursue research and policy that incorporate both Western and Indigenous ways of knowing.\nThis is not a comprehensive account of all co-management or food sovereignty cases in the Pacific Coast. It should be noted that resources pertaining to Mexico have been left out of this list. I made this decision for two reasons: 1) a lack of personal familiarity with Indigenous perspectives and scholarship in Mexico, and 2) differences in political contexts that make policy transferability unclear. There are countries with more policy resonance (New Zealand and Australia, in particular), that were excluded at this time following the intention to highlight connections between dispersed geographies. It is my hope that this resource will be continually improved and others with more knowledge will be able to fill in the gaps.\nConner Smith, the primary author of this resource, is a white settler residing in unceded Chumash lands. He hails from unceded lands of the Catawba, Sugaree, and Waxhaw in what is now North Carolina. Inspiration for this project was drawn from the work of Phoebe Racine on cataloging resources pertaining to Indigenous data sovereignty"

    "text": "A Note on Language\nThis resource will use “Indigenous,” “Native,” and “First Nations” somewhat interchangeably throughout. “Indigenous” is meant to confer the broadest recognition across cultures. “Native” is more contextual to the United States, where “Native American” is a term often used by the federal government. “First Nations” is an analogous term common in Canada. “Tribe” will be used sparingly and specifically in the context of legal agreements or self-identifications (e.g. Coast Treaty Tribes). This generally follows guidance from the Native Governance Center."

    "text": "All lands and seas in North America were once stewarded by Indigenous peoples before the arrival of colonists from Europe. Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz’s An Indigenous Peoples’ History of the United States(2015) is one resource that provides an overview of Native nations and cultures and the legacy of oppression that led to the removal of many from their ancestral lands. The following resources provide an introduction to whose lands are occupied by settler governments with a focus on the United States and Canada.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 0.1: Chumash villages and surrounding Native lands (Source: Wikipedia Commons)\nNative Land Interactive Map Native Land Digital. 2023.\nThis global map – produced by a Canadian non-profit led by First Nations people – provides an overlapping view of Indigenous territory throughout the world. This is more inclusive of different subgroups compared with other resources and provides a way to view ancestral territory throughout the Pacific Coast region.\nU.S. Domestic Sovereign Nations: Land Areas of Federally-Recognized Tribes Bureau of Indian Affairs. 2023.\nThis resource is maintained by the Bureau of Indian Affairs under the U.S. Department of the Interior. According to the Bureau, it shows “the external extent of Federal Indian reservations, land held in ‘trust’ by the United States, ‘restricted fee’ or ‘mixed ownership’ tracts for Federally-recognized tribes and individual Indians.” This is not a complete listing of Native lands in the United States. Rather, it shows the current extent of what the federal government recognizes as Native Land.\nCalifornia Native American Ancestral Lands Los Padres Forest Watch. 2021.\nThis interactive map, built by a non-Indigenous organization in ArcGIS, provides an incomplete, high-level overview of traditional Native territory throughout California. It does not include all of the Native nations and cultures in the State, but provides a helpful interactive tool to explore the overlay of traditional territory with current land use patterns including state and federally designated protected lands.\nNAHC Digital Atlas California Native American Heritage Commission. 2023.\nThis is a state-produced resource with additional information on population distribution, historical events, trade routes, missions, and other data pertaining to Native history in California. The Commission also hosts a written summary of this history and database of Native groups available on the main website."
